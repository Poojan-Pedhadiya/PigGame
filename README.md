# 🐷 Pig Game

Welcome to the **Pig Game**, a fun two-player dice game where strategy and luck come together! Try to reach the winning score before your opponent, but beware of rolling a 1!

## 🎮 How to Play

- Players take turns rolling a die.
- On your turn, you can:
  1. **Roll** the die as many times as you want.
  2. **Hold** to keep your points from that turn.
- But if you roll a **1**, you lose all your points for that turn, and your turn ends!
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.

### 📝 Rules
1. Roll the die: 
    - If you roll **1**, you lose your turn and your current score for that turn.
    - If you roll anything else (2–6), that number is added to your **current turn score**.
2. You can choose to **Hold** at any time to add your **current turn score** to your **total score**.
3. The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game!
